# Emergency Response Data Analysis (CAHOOTS vs EPD)

This repository contains data cleaning, processing, and statistical analysis of emergency response calls in Eugene, Oregon from 2014 to 2025. The analysis compares response times and system capacity between CAHOOTS and the Eugene Police Department (EPD), with a focus on how response patterns vary across call priority levels and resource availability.

The repository is organized into two main parts:
- `cleaning/`: contains data cleaning and preparation notebooks
- `analysis/`: contains statistical analysis notebooks

For more details, see the individual README files in the `cleaning` and `analysis` folders.
